# MultiBot Chatless

### Bridge-first Playerbots control for World of Warcraft 3.3.5a

<strong>MultiBot Chatless</strong> is a client addon for AzerothCore `mod-playerbots`.
It keeps the familiar MultiBot UI while moving more bot reads and actions away from automatic chat commands and into a structured server bridge.

## About This Fork

This repository is a modified fork of [Wishmaster117/MultiBot-Chatless](https://github.com/Wishmaster117/MultiBot-Chatless), based on the original MultiBot addon by Nico Löbbert.

**Fork modifications are maintained by CosmicCuddle.**

**Fork updates — 2–10 October 2026:** this fork adds Naxxramas server-specific Consumables and NT1 Playerbot talent import controls while preserving the upstream MultiBot Chatless code and GPLv3 license.

### Naxxramas Bot Consumables Integration

This fork adds a **Consumables** control to MultiBot for the custom Naxxramas bot consumables system.

The consumables controls require the server-side `BotRaidConsumables.cpp` system from:

- [CosmicCuddle/Mod-Naxxramas-Core](https://github.com/CosmicCuddle/Mod-Naxxramas-Core)
- [BotRaidConsumables.cpp](https://github.com/CosmicCuddle/Mod-Naxxramas-Core/blob/main/src/Systems/BotRaidConsumables.cpp)

Without that server-side system, the custom consumables buttons will not function because the server will not provide the required `.bot consumables ...` commands.

The Naxxramas consumables UI provides:

- named dungeon profiles for Maraudon, Sunken Temple, Blackrock Depths, Scholomance, Stratholme Undead, Dire Maul, Lower Blackrock Spire and Upper Blackrock Spire;
- a custom consumable level input from **1–54** for non-raid dungeons;
- MultiBot-style tooltips and a help panel explaining the consumable system;
- the normal MultiBot Shift + Right-click button swapping behaviour for the main Consumables button.

The rest of MultiBot Chatless continues to use the upstream `mod-multibot-bridge` architecture. The custom Naxxramas consumables controls are an additional server-specific integration and use the commands supplied by `Mod-Naxxramas-Core`.

---


### NT1 Talent Builds — Naxxramas Bot Import (MultiBot 4.0.2 test)

The fork includes **one NT1 Talents button** on the right-hand MultiBot bar, near Consumables. **Both NT1 Talents and Bot Consumables are hidden by default.** Open MultiBot's existing main configuration bar and enable the corresponding book or elixir icon individually; each choice is saved across `/reload` and game restarts. Disabling either hides its right-side button and closes any open submenu/dialog. The visible buttons occupy adjacent slots without a gap when only one is enabled. Target an online bot, click the button and paste an NT1 code copied from [N Talent Calculator](https://github.com/CosmicCuddle/N-Talent-Calculator-) or the [Resource Hub calculator](https://github.com/CosmicCuddle/Naxxramas-Resource-Hub/tree/main/talents).

The refined, taller window avoids overlapping text at enlarged UI scale. It names the selected character, displays the example **NT1:vanilla:warrior:3g-1**, and provides **Preview**, **Apply talents**, and **Cancel**. Pressing **Enter** in the paste box also sends Apply. Preview is read-only; Apply requests an actual talent update. If you change the selected target while the window is open, the request is refused. **Only the server response confirms success.**

The server must already have [Naxxramas Core's BotTalentImport system](https://github.com/CosmicCuddle/Mod-Naxxramas-Core/blob/main/docs/PLAYERBOT-NT1-TALENT-IMPORT.md) compiled and restarted. Its command interface is:

    .naxxbot talents preview <online-botname> <NT1-code>
    .naxxbot talents apply <online-botname> <NT1-code>

The default server setting is **NaxxramasCore.BotTalentImport.AccessMode = 0**, which disables both. Mode 1 allows GMs; mode 2 allows permitted normal players as well. **Both active modes can actually reset bot talents.** Before testing Apply, back up the characters database and the disposable bot's original talents, and review the server's optional SQL and experimental rollback limitations. Random Playerbots may replace imported talents during rerandomisation.

The popup uses the server's separate NT1 command, not the existing premade Playerbots Set talents/Bridge feature. It refuses malformed or empty input, wrong known class, changed target, and anything exceeding one conservative **255-character 3.3.5a chat command**, avoiding silently truncated builds. A longer build will need a future supported transport mechanism.

**Dungeon Consumables (4.0.3 test):** The dungeon-profile bar now reads **Maraudon at the top** through **Upper Blackrock Spire at the bottom** (closest to the Consumables main icon). **Left-click** continues to request the same server consumables profile. **Right-click** any dungeon icon for a read-only overview of its level cap, common role-based elixirs/food/scrolls/potions and the dungeon-specific protection or supplies. Dire Maul shows East/West/North differences; UBRS has Fire Protection and additional consumable supplies. The right-click overview is approximate, not a live report of exactly which items a particular bot received; the server applies only what is eligible for the bot's class, spec, level and physical dungeon/wing. The general Help button remains available.

### Saved NT1 Builds and Website Presets — MultiBot 4.0.4 Test

**NT1 Import is Page 1.** Enter or paste an NT1 code and a name into the new **Save As** field, then click **Save code**. Existing names cannot be overwritten without a second confirming click. **Saved builds >** opens Page 2. It shows saved names, class and era (five per page), lets you load a chosen code back to Page 1, and requires a second click to delete. Saved NT1 codes are **account-wide** in \`MultiBotNT1SavedBuilds\` (part of the MultiBot SavedVariables); they persist across game restarts and are independent of N Talent Calculator and MultiBot's main settings. Save, browse, load and delete do **not** issue server commands. Preview and Apply remain explicit.

**Existing bot's Set Talents button now shows website presets for that bot's class** as a separate third view, with Raid/Solo descriptions and variants. A player can choose a preset and **Load to import**, then Preview/Apply separately. The **Bot specs** button returns to the existing bridge/Playerbots specialization menu, which remains supported. Only verified converted Vanilla NT1 presets from the website are bundled offline: Druid (9), Hunter (8), Mage (3), Priest (7), Rogue (6), Shaman (7), for **40** total. **Warrior and Warlock are deliberately excluded** while those site builds are unfinished; other classes without published converted NT1 links (Paladin and Death Knight) continue opening their existing Bot Specs interface. These presets are a **pinned site snapshot**, not a live internet feed; the exact site commit and regeneration procedure are documented in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

Because Set Talents may be opened from a bot roster without actually targeting that bot in the game world, the import page includes **Confirm target**: target the same bot and confirm before applying. A different target, class mismatch, incompatible expansion, permissions or malformed code will be rejected by the client/server as applicable. No preset is automatically applied when selected.

For installation, detailed tests, risks and rollback, see the [maintainer ROADMAP](ROADMAP.md). The existing public [N Addon Collection v2.0.0](https://github.com/CosmicCuddle/N-Addon-Collection/releases/tag/v2.0.0) is unchanged and still contains approved MultiBot 4.0.

## Companion Bridge Required

This repository contains the **client addon**.

For the bridge-first features you also need:

### [`mod-multibot-bridge`](https://github.com/Wishmaster117/mod-multibot-bridge)

Install the addon as:

```text
World of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns/MultiBot
```

The folder must be named `MultiBot`.

---

# What the Addon Does

MultiBot Chatless provides a UI for controlling, inspecting and managing Playerbots without flooding normal gameplay with automatic bot chat replies.

The addon still supports intentional manual Playerbots commands where they are useful, but the main direction is:

```text
UI action
  -> structured addon message
  -> mod-multibot-bridge
  -> validated server-side action/read
  -> structured result
  -> authoritative UI refresh
```

The project is currently **bridge-first / mostly chatless** rather than fully chatless. Remaining automatic chat paths are migrated only after targeted audit and runtime validation.

---

# Main Features

| Area | Current behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **Bot rosters** | My Bots / Altbots, Group, Guild, Friends and Favorites with online/offline presence and structured lifecycle handling. |
| **Bot connect / disconnect** | `ALT_ROSTER_V1`, `BOT_LIFECYCLE_V1` and `BOT_TARGET_RESOLVE_V1` provide structured discovery, target resolution and lifecycle control. Offline EveryBars stay collapsed; online EveryBars expand consistently. |
| **Bot state & strategies** | Framed bot-state reads and structured strategy mutations for migrated controls, including Warlock selectors. |
| **Inventory** | Bag-aware exact inventory for Backpack, Bag 1..4 and Keyring, including empty slots and container filtering. |
| **Item movement** | Whole-stack drag/drop between supported physical inventory slots through the Bridge. |
| **Equipment** | Structured equip and unequip workflows with authoritative refresh. |
| **Trade & item use** | Exact-item Trade, item use and item destruction through dedicated structured actions. |
| **Vendor** | Single-item sale, bulk Sell Vendor, Buyback and Open Items bridge workflows. |
| **Bank / Guild Bank** | Bridge-backed views and actions; exact physical BANK/GBANK deposits are implemented. |
| **Talents** | Premade specialization apply and editable custom talent apply with server verification. |
| **Naxxramas NT1 Talents** | Selected-bot NT1 paste, server Preview, and experimental Apply through Naxxramas Core, with target and chat-payload safety checks. |
| **Glyphs** | Glyph display and apply-related workflows integrated with the character UI. |
| **Professions** | Profession recipe browsing/crafting plus targeted item recipes. |
| **Enchanting** | Dedicated Enchanting Trade Service using the native WoW Trade workflow. |
| **Quests** | Bridge-backed quest list and structured bot quest abandon. Native quest sharing remains available. |
| **Loot** | Structured loot profiles and exact persistent always-loot item add/remove. |
| **Group tools** | Formation, Roll, RTI, Pull Control, Disperse and other migrated group controls. |
| **Naxxramas consumables** | Fork-specific dungeon consumable controls backed by `Mod-Naxxramas-Core` and `BotRaidConsumables.cpp`. |
| **Character information** | Bot skills, reputations, currencies/emblems, spellbook, stats and PvP stats. |
| **Outfits** | Outfit listing and actions through the Bridge. |
| **SelfBot** | Dedicated enable/disable, strategy and selected action support. |
| **Localization** | Eight runtime locales: `enUS`, `enGB`, `frFR`, `esES`, `deDE`, `ruRU`, `zhCN` and `koKR`. |

# Recent Milestone — Alt Roster & Bot Lifecycle

The roster/lifecycle work was merged and post-merge audited on **30 August 2026**.

It standardizes lifecycle behavior across:

- My Bots / Altbots;
- Group;
- Guild;
- Friends;
- Favorites.

User-facing behavior now follows the same rule everywhere:

- **offline bot** → EveryBar collapsed;
- **online bot** → EveryBar expanded;
- roster-specific UI state must not leak into another roster.

The companion Bridge also gained the server-side lifecycle authorization and hardening required for these flows.

---

# Bridge Capabilities

The addon negotiates feature capabilities with the Bridge before using newer paths.

Important current capabilities include:

```text
STATE_FRAMING_V1
STRATEGY_MUTATION_V1
OUTFIT_V1
INVENTORY_V1
INVENTORY_EXACT_V1
ITEM_MOVE_V1
ITEM_EQUIP_V1
ITEM_UNEQUIP_V1
ITEM_TRADE_V1
ITEM_USE_V1
ITEM_SELL_SINGLE_V1
VENDOR_BUYBACK_V1
INVENTORY_BULK_SELL_V1
INVENTORY_OPEN_V1
ITEM_DEPOSIT_EXACT_V1
GROUP_ROLL_V1
ENCHANT_TRADE_V1
CRAFT_RECIPE_TARGET_V1
QUEST_ABANDON_V1
LOOT_RULE_ITEM_V1
TALENT_APPLY_V1
TALENT_SPEC_APPLY_V1
SELF_BOT_V1
SELF_STRATEGY_V1
SELF_ACTION_V1
ALT_ROSTER_V1
BOT_LIFECYCLE_V1
BOT_TARGET_RESOLVE_V1
```

The exact protocol is an implementation detail of the addon and Bridge. The normal user experience should remain UI-driven.

---

# Compatibility & Legacy Chat

The addon deliberately keeps some manual Playerbots commands for diagnostics and explicit gameplay use.

Automatic compatibility fallback is disabled by default:

```lua
MultiBot.allowLegacyChatFallback = false
```

When a migrated Bridge feature is available, the addon should prefer the structured path and wait for authoritative server state instead of pretending an action succeeded locally.

---

# Installation

1. Install and configure AzerothCore with `mod-playerbots`.
2. Install [`mod-multibot-bridge`](https://github.com/Wishmaster117/mod-multibot-bridge) on the server and rebuild AzerothCore.

### Naxxramas consumables requirement

To use the custom **Consumables** controls in this fork, the server must also include [`Mod-Naxxramas-Core`](https://github.com/CosmicCuddle/Mod-Naxxramas-Core) with [`src/Systems/BotRaidConsumables.cpp`](https://github.com/CosmicCuddle/Mod-Naxxramas-Core/blob/main/src/Systems/BotRaidConsumables.cpp) compiled and loaded.

This requirement applies specifically to the Naxxramas consumables controls; the normal MultiBot Chatless features continue to depend on the upstream bridge as documented above.

3. Copy or clone this repository as:

```text
World of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns/MultiBot
```

4. Start the server and log into the WoW 3.3.5a client.
5. Confirm the addon and Bridge handshake successfully.

---

# Usage

Open MultiBot with any of these slash commands:

```text
/multibot
/mbot
/mb
```

You can also open the addon from its minimap button.

When the Bridge is available, supported UI actions automatically use the structured bridge-first path; you do not need to type protocol commands manually.

---

# Current Status

The major read paths and a large part of the action surface are now bridge-first and runtime validated.

The project is **not declared fully chatless yet**. Remaining `SendChatMessage` paths are handled family by family so that useful manual commands are not removed accidentally and legacy compatibility is not broken without testing.

The next normal roadmap item is a targeted audit of collective:

```text
follow
attack
stay
```

No generic arbitrary Playerbots command executor is planned.

Detailed development history, audits, deferred work and technical residuals are tracked in the project documentation.

# Documentation

- [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) — current Naxxramas fork development handover: target feature, source paths, prerequisites, backups, exact next task and testing status.
- [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md) — retained bridge-migration history, audits and upstream backlog.
- [`docs/DEBUG_RUNBOOK.md`](docs/DEBUG_RUNBOOK.md) — in-game debug commands, observability guidance and bug-report procedure.

# Deferred / Lower-Priority Work

The active roadmap currently keeps these items outside the next normal feature batch:

- exact BANK withdrawal (P3B);
- exact Guild Bank withdrawal (P3C);
- dedicated localized `SOURCE_STALE` UI text;
- moving/re-equipping the equipped bag objects themselves (`BAG_MOVE`);
- `SELL_GREY` follow-up;
- final real Firestone/Spellstone `TEMP_ENCHANTMENT_SLOT` revalidation;
- remaining Warlock LuaLint warnings;
- selected lifecycle/idempotence hardening for older pending-command flows.

# Troubleshooting

### The addon does not load

Confirm the folder is named exactly:

```text
MultiBot
```

and is located under:

```text
World of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns/
```

### Bridge features are unavailable

Confirm `mod-multibot-bridge` is installed, configured, compiled and loaded by the same AzerothCore server used by the client.

### I still see some Playerbots chat

That does not automatically mean the Bridge is broken. Manual commands and a small number of intentionally retained or not-yet-migrated paths still exist while the project remains **mostly chatless**.
